#Redux Toolkit

1. Create a redux store using "createStore".
2. Connect the store with react app using "Provider".
3. Create a slice using "createSlice".
    - name
    - initial state
    - reducers -> action with reducer function.
4. Export actions and reducer from slice.
5. Add slice to the store.
6. Subscribe to the slice using useSelector hook.
